      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What types of financing do you offer?</h3>
        <p>We connect small business owners to multiple solutions including term loans, SBA loans, merchant cash advances, lines of credit, equipment financing, invoice factoring, PO financing, CRE lending, card processing, credit repair, and marketing funding.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How fast can I get funding?</h3>
        <p>Speed depends on the product. MCA and lines of credit can fund in 1–3 days, while SBA loans may take several weeks. We help you find the right fit for your timeline.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you require collateral?</h3>
        <p>Some products (like SBA and equipment loans) may require collateral. Others, like merchant cash advances or unsecured lines of credit, do not.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does applying affect my credit?</h3>
        <p>Our initial application uses a soft pull, meaning it won’t impact your credit. Hard pulls only occur if you decide to move forward with a specific funding option.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can you consolidate my existing advances or loans?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Consolidation is one of our specialties — we can combine multiple positions into a single manageable payment, often reducing stress and freeing up cash flow.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What documents do I need?</h3>
        <p>Usually just the last 3 months of business bank statements. Depending on the product, additional docs (like tax returns or equipment invoices) may be requested.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who do you work with?</h3>
        <p>We’ve helped everyone from restaurants and construction companies to trucking fleets and online retailers. If you generate revenue and want growth, we’re here.</p>
